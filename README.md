# Customer-Segmentation-Clustering
In this project we focus on applying unsupervised clustering techniques to customer data from a grocery retailer's database. The goal is to implement customer segmentation, a strategy that groups customers based on shared characteristics. By categorizing customers into distinct segments, we aim to maximize each customer's value to the company. This segmentation will enable us to tailor our product offerings to meet the specific needs and preferences of different customer groups. Additionally, it will allow the business to address the unique concerns of various customer types more effectively. Ultimately, this approach will help us better understand and serve our diverse customer base, potentially leading to improved customer satisfaction and business performance.

# About The Data
Customer Personality Analysis is a detailed analysis of a company’s ideal customers. It helps a business to better understand its customers and makes it easier for them to modify products according to the specific needs, behaviors and concerns of different types of customers.

Customer personality analysis helps a business to modify its product based on its target customers from different types of customer segments. For example, instead of spending money to market a new product to every customer in the company’s database, a company can analyze which customer segment is most likely to buy the product and then market the product only on that particular segment.
